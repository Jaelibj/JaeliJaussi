    "section": "Part 4: Visualization",
    "text": "Part 4: Visualization\nNow that we have explored and preprocessed our data, let’s create a visualization to summarize our findings.\n\nExploration vs Presentation\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of visualizations: * Barebones visualizations you might use to get a quick, visual understanding of the data while you’re trying to decide how it all fits together. * Presentation-quality visualizations that you would include in a report or presentation for management or other stakeholders.\n\n\nVisualization Tools\nThere are many different visualization tools availble. In the sections below, we’ll explore the three most common. Each of these libraries has strengths and weaknesses.\nIt is probably a good idea for you to become familiar with each one, and then become proficient at whichever one you like the best.\n\n\nAltair\nThe Altair visualization library provides a large variety of very easy to use statistical charting tools.\nAltair uses a declarative language to build up charts piece by piece.\nAssume we have a pandas dataframe called employees, with three columns: name, job, salary.\n# Make a box plot style categorical plot showing the distribution of salaries for each job:\nalt.Chart(employees).mark_boxplot().encode(\n    x='job',\n    y='salary'\n)\n\n# Make a box plot style categorical plot, and customize the results\nalt.Chart(employees).mark_boxplot().encode(\n    alt.X('job', title='Job title'),\n    alt.Y('salary', title='Annual salary in thousands of $USD')\n).properties(\n  title='Salaries by Job Title'\n)\nLike with Pandas, there is a conventional way to import Altair into your projects.\n\n# Import the Altair library the conventional way.\n\nLet’s create a barchart showing the count of each movie rating by using Altair’s aggregation capabilities.\nIn this example, we see the x axis being set to a feature called a, and the y axis set to the average() of a feature called b.\nIn our case, we want the x axis to be set to rating and the y axis to be the count() of rating.\n\n# Use Altair to create a bar chart comparing the count of each movie rating\n\n\n\nSeaborn\nWhile Altair uses a “declarative” syntax for building charts piece by piece, the Seaborn library provides a large variety of pre-made charts for common statistical needs.\nThese charts are divided into different categories. Each category has a high-level interface you can use for simplicity, and then a specific function for each chart that you can use if you need more control over how the chart looks.\nSeaborn uses matplotlib for its drawing, and the chart-specific functions each return a matplitlib axes object if you need additional customization.\nFor example, there are several different types of categorical plots in seaborn: bar plots, box plots, point plots, count plots, swarm plots, etc…\nEach of these plots can be accessed using the catplot function.\nAssume we have a pandas dataframe called employees, with three columns: name, job, salary.\n# Make a box plot style categorical plot showing the distribution of salaries for each job:\nsns.catplot(data=employees, x='job', y='salary', kind='box')\n\n# Make a swarm plot style categorical plot\nsns.catplot(data=employees, x='job', y='salary', kind='swarm')\nAlternatively, you can use the plot specific functions to give yourself more control over the output by using matplotlib functions:\n# Make a box plot style categorical plot, and customize the results\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 9))\nax = sns.boxplot(data=employees, x='job', y='salary')\nax.set_title(\"Salaries by Job Title\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Annual salary in thousands of $USD\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Job title\")\nLike with Pandas, there is a conventional way to import Seaborn into your projects.\nOptionally, you may wish to set some default chart aesthetics by setting the chart style.\n\n# Import the seaborn library the conventional way. Then optionally configure\n# the default chart style.\n\nSince the rating column uses categorical data, we need to use Seaborn’s categorical visualizations.\nIn particular, we want a “count plot” that will display a count of movie ratings.\n\n# Use seaborn to create a count plot comparing the count of each movie rating\n\n\n\nPandas built-in plotting\nIn addition to libraries like Altair and Seaborn, Pandas has some built in charting functionality.\nWhile not as sophisticated as some of the other options, it is often good enough for quick visualizations.\nJust like with seaborn’s plotting functions, the pandas plotting functions return matplotlib axes objects, which can be further customized.\nAssume we have a pandas dataframe called employees, with three columns: name, job, salary.\n# Make a box plot style categorical plot showing the distribution of salaries for each job:\nemployees[ ['job','salary'] ].plot.box()\n\n# Make a box plot style categorical plot, and customize the results\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 9))\nax = employees[ ['job','salary'] ].plot().box()\nax.set_title(\"Salaries by Job Title\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Annual salary in thousands of $USD\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Job title\")\n\n# Use pandas' built in plotting functions to create a count plot comparing the count of each movie rating\n# This will be a little trickier than the other libraries, but one hint is that the pandas value_counts() function\n# actually returns a dataframe."

The easiest way to accomplish this would be to create a new column in your data frame that maps each rating to the appropriate “For Kids” or “For Adults” label, then create a new visualization based on that column."

I engineered an additional feature representing square footage per floor to capture how living space is distributed across levels. The model was evaluated using RMSE and R² to provide quantifiable evidence of prediction reliability. Feature importance scores were used to identify which aspects of the property most strongly influence price, addressing stakeholder questions about key drivers of value. Geographic variables were included to support future integration of external neighborhood-level factors.\nAttempting to work with zipcode, lat, long.\n\n# Using \"Homes in area are similiar\"\nzip_stats = housing.groupby('zipcode')['price'].agg([\n    'mean', 'median', 'count'\n]).reset_index()\n\nzip_stats.columns = ['zipcode', 'zip_price_mean', 'zip_price_median', 'zip_count']\n\nhousing = housing.merge(zip_stats, on='zipcode', how='left')\n\nzip_price_mean - average price per area\nzip_count - quantity of homes\n\n# categorize into natural geographical areas\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\ncoords = housing[['lat', 'long']]\n\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=20, random_state=42)\nhousing['geo_cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(coords)\n\nX = housing[[\n    \"sqft_living\", \"sqft_lot\", \"condition\", \"grade\", \"view\",\n    \"sqft_lot15\", \"sqft_per_floor\", \"geo_cluster\"\n]]\n\n\n# Creating distance variable\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Approx Seattle city center\nseattle_lat, seattle_long = 47.6062, -122.3321\n\nhousing['dist_to_seattle'] = np.sqrt(\n    (housing['lat'] - seattle_lat)**2 +\n    (housing['long'] - seattle_long)**2\n)\n\n\n# Each zipcode is a redefined category\nhousing_encoded = pd.get_dummies(housing, columns=['zipcode'], prefix='zip')\n\nX = housing_encoded[[\n    \"sqft_living\", \"sqft_lot\", \"condition\", \"grade\", \"view\",\n    \"sqft_lot15\", \"sqft_per_floor\"\n] + [col for col in housing_encoded.columns if col.startswith('zip_')]]\n\n\nhousing['sqft_per_floor'] = housing['sqft_living'] / housing['floors']\n\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=20, random_state=42)\nhousing['geo_cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(housing[['lat', 'long']])\n\nzip_stats = housing.groupby('zipcode')['price'].mean().reset_index()\nzip_stats.columns = ['zipcode', 'zip_price_mean']\nhousing = housing.merge(zip_stats, on='zipcode', how='left')\n\nfeatures = [\n    \"sqft_living\",\n    \"sqft_lot\",\n    \"sqft_lot15\",\n    \"condition\",\n    \"grade\",\n    \"view\",\n    \"sqft_per_floor\",\n    \"geo_cluster\",\n    \"zip_price_mean\"\n]\n\nLatitude, longitude, and zipcode do not correlate well with price when treated as raw numerical values. To capture neighborhood-level pricing effects, I transformed location features into meaningful geographic groupings. Homes were clustered into geographic regions using latitude and longitude, creating a neighborhood identifier. Additionally, zipcode-level price averages were computed to capture typical market values by area. These transformations allowed the model to learn area-based pricing patterns and significantly improved predictive performance.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
